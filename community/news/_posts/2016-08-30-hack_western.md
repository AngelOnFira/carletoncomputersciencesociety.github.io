Hackathons are a great way to develop your technical skills and explore areas of interest. Western University will be hosting their own hackathon on **October 14-16, 2016** and it is open to all students. Check out their website for more details.

If you are interested, **apply here before September 7, 2016**. Itâ€™s free to attend and there will be transportation from Carleton University. 

If you have any questions, please email the Carleton rep at [elisa.kazan@ccss.carleton.ca](mailto:elisa.kazan@ccss.carleton.ca) or ask the organizers at [hello@hackwestern.com](hello@hackwestern.com).

Hope to see you there!
