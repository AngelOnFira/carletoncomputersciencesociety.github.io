Alex Benay, Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the Government of Canada is inviting you to apply to participate in the 2017 CIO Summit Hackathon. This hackathon will be a two-day brainstorming marathon where interdisciplinary teams will work together to solve problems or explore opportunities that the CIO’s have identified!
 
It will be a wonderful opportunity for participants to learn and network with the Government of Canada IT leaders, industry professionals and digital enthusiasts. At the end of the second day, teams will get an opportunity to showcase their “hacks” to GC IT leaders in a “Dragons’ Den” fashion.
 
Participation is not limited to the technically inclined; any person interested in strengthening Canada’s digital future is welcome to join. We believe this would be a valuable experience for students or faculty in the areas of business, political science, public affairs, communications, law, information technology, computer science, etc.
 
This event will be limited to 36 participants and will take place on June 26th and June 27th.
