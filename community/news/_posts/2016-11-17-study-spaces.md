The CCSS is aware of the lab and study space concerns many of you are having and weâ€™re going to make sure your voices are heard! 
We have scheduled a meeting with the School of Computer Science on January 3rd, 2017 where we plan to bring up all of your comments.
To ensure we don't forget anything, please 
[write down any comments or concerns you have in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vmO52iWl57RoBBkXRHuTcJK_ofAhZCyh8tJJfH3SCdM/edit?usp=sharing)
and we will do our best to fix it. 

Some concerns we plan to address:

* **More Lab and Study Spaces:** Quite and/or collaborative study spaces that do not hold tutorials during the day. 
* **Bigger CCSS Lounge:** A social space for students to meet other CS students, hang out in between classes and use the resources that the CCSS provides.
* **Better Academic Services:** Create study groups, a mentorship program or other system to ensure students get the academic support they need. Also figure out a system for students looking for tutoring services.

Thanks!
