  <h1>Governance</h1>

  <p>As a society we try our best to be as open as we can be. This page contains links to all the important information regarding our goveranance.</p>
  <h5>Our constitution</h5>
  <p>The CCSS Constitution defines the basic rules the Society must abide by
  to remain in control of its assets and dissolution and operation procedures
  for the Society. We need to hold a general meeting to change this document. You can find it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19J_VtsAwwNvA3cS8ZJgDod8yLLnmZG_As7XgiVlkzHE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>

  <h5>Our rules of operation</h5>
  <p>The rules of operation are rules that the board of directors can change
  within a meeting as long as the society membership is notified. You can
  find them <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GdX5OPCI5gdbViDAfCIbFto6tgNxH-gwHzLy9e2S3o8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>

  <h5>The board of directors</h5>
  <p>The CCSS board of directors is a group of both elected and appointed
  individuals in charge of managing the CCSS. For a list of the people
  on the board of directors and vacancies look <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p5wtaC4HHkZ22oF5IOCVIoCNwzcxfI3XUit_ZuaT0Lg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
