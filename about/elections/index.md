  <h1>2018 General Elections</h1>
  <h6>The nomination period for the 2018 CCSS General Election is over! Here are the confirmed nominees:</h6>

  <h2>President nominations</h2>
  <h5>Elisa Kazan</h5>
  <p>A few goals for the coming year are to ensure computer science students are aware of all
  the opportunities and events that are happening on and off campus (aka knowing when to
  apply for those awesome hackathons and conferences!). Provide a wide range of resources
  for students (study spaces, printing, technical interview prep) that are easily accessible. A
  bigger lounge area would be nice too! Build a stronger community and CS pride through the
  creation and distribution of CCSS merchandise. Connect with other groups and societies on
  campus to create bigger and better events. Continue improving the End of Year BBQ,
  reaching out to alumni making it even bigger next year.</p>

  <h2>Vice President nominations</h2>
  <h5>Aidan Crowther</h5>
  <p>If elected, I intend to expand upon the services and opportunities provided to members and
  volunteers of the CCSS, while also striving to improve our outreach and accessibility to
  students. I intend to do so by working in key areas such as: Improving upon, and maintaining
  our rewards system for volunteers and board members, including our offering of CCR credit
  for these positions. I also intend to expand our offered learning opportunities by working
  closely with our VP Academics in order to ensure that we can offer as much high quality and
  valuable material as possible. Improving our outreach and availability to students is also one
  of my goals, with the hopes that we can attract more of our members to events, as well as
  making our doings and information more easily accessible and understood. I intend to do
  this by working closely with the President and other VPs in order to ensure that all tasks and
  responsibilities are met, and dealt with accordingly, while also assisting in any way possible,
  while also keeping the views and opinions of our members in mind.</p>

  <h2>VP Social nominations</h2>
  <h5>William So</h5>
  <p>As VP Social, I will take on the responsibility of communicating CCSS news, events, and
  other important information to our members, through social media such as Facebook and
  Slack, and through email newsletter. With these open lines of communication, I will
  encourage the CCSS members to attend our events. I also plan to organize many social get-
  togethers, such as regular coffee socials and movie nights, as well as social outings such as
  The Loft.</p>

  <h2>VP Academics nominations</h2>
  <h5>Forest Anderson</h5>
  <p>I will start off the year with a tech talk during the Week of Awesome. I will run workshops
  about useful technologies and technical skills. I plan on working closely with the Ottawa
  Game Development Collective, as well as hack.carleton.</p>

  <h5>Jeremy Tian</h5>
  <p>I will ensure the voices of students are heard at university meetings, host spectacular
  extracurricular academic events for CS students, and guarantee effective academic support
  workshops.</p>

  <h2>Treasurer nominations</h2>
  <h5>Benjamin Karstad</h5>
  <p>As treasurer, I will strive for improved communication with members and what they want to
  see funded in the future, transparency of the budget and where funds are allocated,
  coordination with third parties to sponsor events, and ensuring economical spending of
  allocated funds and minimizing wastefulness.</p>
